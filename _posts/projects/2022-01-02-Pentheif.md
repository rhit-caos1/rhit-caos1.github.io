## Project

<p>In this project, a Trossen PincherX 100 robot arm was programmed to autonomously pick up a purple pen in the working space.</p>
<br>
<p>An Intel Realsense D435i camera is used to provide RGB and depth information to the computer. To detect the purple pen in the workspace, the HSV image format is used to detect any purple object that shows up in the camera field because HSV can decrease the effect of light which can change the RGB color. Then a binary contour map is created by using OpenCV to find the center of the purple area. This can provide an aiming point in the image, and use that point and the depth information to build the three-dimensional coordinate in the workspace. Next, the coordinate frame is transferred to the robot frame and pass to the robot control node. The robot can now plan the path to the pen's location and grab it.</p>
