<center><h2>The interface of this simulator.</h2></center>

<p>Transmission Voie-Machine (TVM, English: track-to-train transmission) is a very powerful cab signaling system used on high-speed railway lines in France. It can provide useful signal and speed information for train engineers and automatically adjust the expected speed curve to control the safety gap between trains. The functions it provides are essential for high-speed train operation. In this project, a simulator build from scratch is used to simulate the fundamental functions of this system.</p>
<br>
<p>The real system contain two major parts: the ground base transmitter provides track information and the receiver on the train. In this project, the transmitter is represented by a Raspberry Pi board with bluetooth and receiver is represented by the computer. The Raspberry Pi stores the track information like signal, speed limit, and distance. The computer provides current position information to the Paspberry pi. Then the Pi send the next and current track information to the computer. The control system on the computer uses the information to control the current train speed and shows the information on the gui for train driver. I programmed Raspberry Pi in C and Python to connect to the bluetooth modual. The computer side program are in Python, Java, and MATLAB tpo create the gui and speed monitoring system.</p>
