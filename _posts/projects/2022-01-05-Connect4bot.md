### Intro
<br>


<p>This project, part of MECH_ENG 395: Industry 4.0 Manufacturing, introduces the Connect 4 Master Robot. Our innovation merges robotics and gaming, presenting a system capable of engaging in Connect 4 matches with human players. Beyond its gaming prowess, this robot boasts the potential to serve as a remote intermediary for players physically distant from each other, providing a live visual interface for an immersive, shared Connect 4 experience, transcending geographical boundaries.</p>
<br>

### Robot and control
<br>
<p>In this project, we employed a LewanSoul xArm as the physical computer player. This robot is operated using an Arduino board, which not only controls the robot but also detects the coins dropped by the human player onto the Connect 4 gaming board. To accomplish this, we utilized IR break sensors to accurately detect every coin drop through the top row of the borad.</p>

<br>

<p>During operation, the robot waits for the player to place the first coin. Using IR sensors, it detects the column where the coin is inserted, sending this data to the connected computer. The computer mirrors the game board and computes the optimal move. Once determined, the next action is relayed to the Arduino, which commands the robot to execute the move. The robot collects a coin from the feeder, drops it into the designated column on the playing board, and awaits the human player's next move. This sequence repeats until one side achieves victory. </p>
